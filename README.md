This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To make sure you are running correct node version(10.15.3 (npm v6.4.1))
### `nvm use 10.15.3`
To install Packages
### `yarn install`
To run project
### `yarn start`

The API has CORS issue so I am using a chrome extension to allow requests
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi
you can run chrome with disabled web security also to allow it instead of installing the extension. 

Project is deployed to (https://football-app-react.herokuapp.com/) but still CORS policy is blocking requests
